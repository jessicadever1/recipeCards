# recipeCards

To do:
1) Figure out how to make the large pic below the nav bar span the width of the page, and grow and shrink correctly.

2) Get the Recipe Catagory (breakfast, lunch, etc) select to work correctly
  
      DONE a) have options
  
      DONE b) appropriate font size
  
      c) when selected, communicate appropiately to the submit button, that when submit button is clicked, to send the recipe to the correct page (breakfast, lunch, dinner, etc).
  
DONE 3) Switch the unit imput to a select button (ranging from tsp to cup, for example)

4) (semi) complete the form on the homepage. 

5) get all of the ingrident input features to list unit and quanity types

6) get add ingredient button to work
 
    a) list all four input components 

7) get complete recipe button to work
 
    a) save recipe card to appropriate meal page with all user-provided info
    
DONE 8) get outer edges of recipe card elements to line up. I think padding will fix this.
