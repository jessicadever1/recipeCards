                    <article>
                        <p class="background">When I was growing up baking and cooking were not things either of my parents enjoyed, nor did I even bother to consider! As an adult, I started exploring health, fitness and nutrition, as a way to transition into an office setting without putting on weight. I started learning how to cook from the VERY bottom. I mean I used phrases like so, the freezer is kind of like a time-machine, right? Whole30 Cookbooks, Pinterest and the good ole Internet taught me a lot. Eventually, I do grow tired of the same genre of cooking, so eventually I tried my hand at being Vegan. This lasted three months, only because I couldn't figure out how to get enough protein or keep my energy levels where I wanted them. Okay, and I missed cheese! But the idea of eating meat has very little appeal at this point, so I've switched to vegetarian recipes. Since these three styles are the areas I've tried out, I'll give these recipes and indicate which of these catagories they fall into.</p>
